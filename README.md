# autoEdit Sketches

High fidelity (non functional) proof of concept prototype/sketches in html, client side js and bootstrap for [autoEdit](http://www.autoEdit.io).

More meant to showcase core functions, components and structure of project from a user flow point of view, rather then UX/UI decisions. 


see  [autoEdit](http://www.autoEdit.io) for the actual working projec.t
